A modern tool for composing and playing back chiptune music for platforms using the AY-3-8910/YM2149 sound chips — ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari ST, and others. While the name references ZX Spectrum, the architecture is chip-agnostic and designed to support additional sound chips in the future. Built with JUCE, targeting macOS, Windows, and Linux, with iOS and Android possible. Features a timeline-based DAW interface with precise chip emulation.

## Features

**Three applications from one codebase:**

- **µZX Studio** — full-featured PSG music editor with timeline, instruments, and effects. Includes µZX Tuning.
- **µZX Player** — lightweight playback for `.uzx` projects and `.psg` files with drag-drop support, file associations, and keyboard shortcuts
- **µZX Tuning** — standalone tuning table editor for exploring chip tuning systems. (Included in µZX Studio as a built-in tool)

## Vision

µZX is being developed as the music subsystem of **MoTool** — a planned demotool for retrocomputer demoscene production. MoTool does not exist as a release yet; it will launch as a separate project on the shared codebase once the timeline supports video material and emulator integration. See [docs/Vision.md](docs/Vision.md) for the full picture.

**Music composition:**

- Timeline-based arranging with tracks, clips, and automation
- **Multiple chips** — add chip plugins to multiple tracks or load multiple PSGs to separate tracks for multi-chip compositions.
- ChipInstrument plugin with ADSR envelopes for AY chip
- MIDI to PSG conversion with configurable tuning systems
- Real-time AY-3-8910/YM2149 emulation via [ayumi](https://github.com/true-grue/ayumi)

**Tuning systems:**

- 12-TET, 5-Limit Just Intonation, and custom tuning tables
- Visual tuning grid with note tooltips and scale highlighting
- Configurable chip clock frequency and A4 reference
- CSV export of tuning tables

**Visualization & Interaction:**

- PSG clip display with notes, noise/envelope decoration, and note pitch scale
- Integrated oscilloscope displays per AY channel with live monitoring
- Standalone scope plugin
- Smooth timeline scrolling and zooming with click-to-seek

## Download

See [Releases](https://github.com/Pixel-Matter/uZX/releases) for pre-built binaries.

### macOS Setup

If you encounter a quarantine warning when opening the app, clear it with:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/µZX\ Player.app
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/µZX\ Studio.app
```

(Replace app paths as needed. Adjust for your installation location, e.g., `~/Applications/` if installed there.)

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Pixel-Matter/uZX.git
